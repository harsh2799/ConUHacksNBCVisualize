## What it does
Imagine a web-based application that allows users to easily visualize and analyze the performance of their favorite stocks. The application features a clean and intuitive user interface, with a variety of customizable charts and data tables that display key metrics such as stock price, most popular stocks and stocks with most engagements. Users could select their preferred stocks from a list of the top performers in the market, or search for specific stocks by  symbol. Once selected, the stock data would be displayed in a variety of interactive charts, including line charts and bar charts. One of the most significant  feature of the application is its capability to detect anomalies in the records, anomalies are the inconsistent records which are drifting away from the normal behaviour of the data.
